# Neural-Network-Charity-Analysis

This Repository contains an Analysis Pertaining To Analyzing Data About Charitable Donations And Classifying That Data (By Utilizing Deep Learning Neural Networks And TensorFlow).



Objective:

The Purpose for this Analysis is to Analyze Data About Charitable Donations And Classifying That Data (By Utilizing Deep Learning Neural Networks And TensorFlow).



Results:


## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model:



## Merged Data Frame:

• The IS_SUCCESSFUL Variable Is The Target For My Model.

• The APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, And ASK_AMT Variables Are The Features For My Model. 

• The EIN And NAME Variables Are Not Features Or Targets For My Model So They Shall Be Removed From The Input Data. 



## Deliverable 2: Compiling, Training, And Evaluating The Model:

• This Model Contains Two Hidden Layers With 80 Neurons And 30 Neurons. The Input Data Contains 43 Features And 25,724 Samples.

• I Was Not Able To Achieve The Target Model Performance Since The Accuracy Of My Model Stayed A Little Under 75% Each Time. 

• I Tried To Increase The Performance Of My Model By Utilizing A Model With Three Hidden Layers (Which I Tested In Deliverable 3). 



## Deliverable 3: Optimizing The Model: 



## Attempt 1:

Summary: 


• The Model Did Not Meet Performance Expectations Since The Accuracy Of It Stayed A Little Under 75% Each Time. 

• I Could Have Utilized A Different Type Of Model For Testing My Model Like The Random Forest Classifier For Instance.
